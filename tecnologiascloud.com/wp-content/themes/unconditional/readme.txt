Languages: Many thanks go to the following translators...
Bulgarian translation by George Atanassov - http://magnifish.eu/

If you have translated this theme to your local language it would be awesome if you can share it with other users - send us a copy of your .mo & .po files 
and we will be more than happy to add the to the theme while giving full credit :)

This is the lite version of the theme with minimal options - premium version will include options to switch backgrounds/colors for the various sections,
multiple color selectors for the various elements (via an enhanced customizer section) plus much much more...

Known Limitations:

Menu: Site menu does not display by default - you will need to allocate a menu to the theme location.
Menu: With Bootstrap the top level item on a dropdown menu is only meant as a pointer i.e. does not link out.
It is therefore recommended to use a custom link leaving the url blank to act as the pointer item and then add other pages to it as submenu items.
Header: Content within the header is governed by the set header height - it is therefore recommended to keep these i.e. Site Title, Site description and CTA contents short and concise
